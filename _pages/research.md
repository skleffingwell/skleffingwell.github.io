## Dissertation Project

My dissertation is concerned with variation in new democracies' behavior in the realm of multilateral cooperation. It aims to identify the fundmentally domestic motivations for systematic behaviors at the international level, merging comparative political work on democratic transition and consolidation to the performance of liberal multilateral agreements.


While exisitng theories group these new democracies into a single basket, such as the anocracies of Polity IV, I argue that fundmental differences in the regime transition experience of new democracies produces observable and systematic patterns of participation in multilateral agreements. Depending on the circumstances of a country's democratic transition, the new regime faces differing levels of challenge to their legitimacy, and differing levels of threat from elites from the authoritarian period. New democracies, such as those in Europe, that experience more diffuse support from the general public and more threat from still-active authoritarian elites are eager to participate in liberal multilateral agreements in order to engender trust in the national population.
