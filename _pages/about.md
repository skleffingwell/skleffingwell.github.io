I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I study International Relations and Comparative Politics.

Substantively, I am interested in Democratic Transitions and Consoldation, Multilateral Agreements, and the interplay between the two. My regional interests lie in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Eurasia.
