I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I study International Relations and Comparative Politics.

Substantively, I am interested in the domestic side of multilateral agreements and legitimacy in new democracies. My regional interests lie in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Eurasia.
